Implement `buildWeeklyPlan({goalType, focusHours, teamSize, syncFrequency})` returning `{summary, days:[{day, focusBlock, syncBlock, note}]}`. In `public/app.js`, read form values, call `buildWeeklyPlan`, render a list/table, and store/load JSON under `beatrock:weekly-plan`. Include an empty state and a “Reset plan” action. Tests should cover each goal type, edge cases (0 focus hours, large teams), and stable ordering of days.
